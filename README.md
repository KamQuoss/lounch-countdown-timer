## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM methodology
- svg sprite
- flexibility using clamp
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS library


### What I learned

- css transformation
- css animation
- css filters
- css clamp function
- css clip path
- js Date
- project hierarchy
- preparing environment with vite
- using svg sprites

In this project I found most challenging to make animation start once the number on flap display changes. I have solve this problem by toggling classes which starts animation on flap displays.
Another difficulty was managing time. I found that js intervals aren't very precise, so I've done some workaround. Every second the current time is checked and set as a Counter state.
